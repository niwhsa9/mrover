""" Controls an ODrive motor controller to drive the wheels.
The ODrives codebase deals with controlling the ODrive motor controllers to
drive the wheels. For the 2022 Mars Rover Rosie, there are 3 ODrive motor
controllers to drive the wheels. Each ODrive connects to the Jetson via USB.
Each ODrive has two axes and each axis is assigned a wheel. To simplify wiring
and code, the axis of each ODrive are either all left or all right. Also, the
wheels that are connected to one singular ODrive are opposite each other (i.e.
an ODrive is assigned either the front, middle, or back wheels).
