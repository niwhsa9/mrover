  # NONE        This mode does not compute any depth map. Only rectified stereo images will be available.
  # PERFORMANCE Computation mode optimized for speed.
  # QUALITY     Computation mode designed for challenging areas with untextured surfaces.
  # ULTRA       Computation mode favoring edges and sharpness. Requires more GPU memory and computation power.
  # NEURAL      End to End Neural disparity estimation, requires AI module.

  # Threshold to reject depth values based on their confidence.
  # Each depth pixel has a corresponding confidence. The confidence range is [1,100].
  # By default, the confidence threshold is set at 100, meaning that no depth pixel will be rejected.
  # Decreasing this value will remove depth data from both objects edges and low textured areas, to keep only confident depth estimation data.
  # Pixels with a value close to 100 are not to be trusted. Accurate depth pixels tends to be closer to lower values.
  # It can be seen as a probability of error, scaled to 100.
